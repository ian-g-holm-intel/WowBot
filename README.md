# WoWBot
This was a custom combat rotation/auction bot written for Wow Classic that used weak auras to display status info in the corner of the display as a collection of pixels that could be easily read by the bot without ever interacting with process memory.
Unfortuantely I made a fatal mistake of getting a process handle for the purpose of sending keyboard input to the specific window. This ultimately lead to my account getting banned for a year and a half. 

This bot almost certainly wouldn't work in its current state but the basic principals are still valid and could likely be updated to work with some effort. Keep in mind, it did get me banned, so use at your own risk.
